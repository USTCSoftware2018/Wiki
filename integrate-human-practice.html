                    <h3>Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan</h3>
                        <p>We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chung Hsing University from July 30th to August 3rd 2018. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 5 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.</p>

                    <h3>Software Promotion</h3>
                        <p>Since our software is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists, itâ€™s of great importance to promote our software to synthetic biology related users.</p>
                        <p>To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, We packed up an alpha version distributing to schoolmates whose major is biology in September. And in October we packed a more advanced version to some igem teams worldwide. We introduced them to Bioeditor and its basic usage. After they had used this software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful. And then we have packed our completed version to the real synthetic biologists by now.</p>
