            <h3>Science and Technology Week</h3>
            <p>Science and Technology Week is is a large-scale, centralized science popularization campaign organized by
                the China University of Science and Technology. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over
                ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils, high school students and college students
                in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic
                Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge and a
                chance to cultivate interest in biology.</p>
            <p>We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation and our explanation,
                then showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We educate
                and inspire visitors' interest by allowing them to observe biochemical-related sections under a
                laboratory microscope. In addition, we distributed questionnaires to visitors to get their feedback on
                synthetic biology to improve our design of our software.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3>Student Open Source Conference</h3>
            <p>The Student Open Source Annual Meeting is the first open source technology summit in China that is
                organized by student organizations. The main theme of the conference is understanding, participating in,
                and contributing to open source. Our team signed up for this annual meeting.At the meeting, our team
                leader and a team member worked together to complete the report on our iGEM project. We introduced the
                iGEM competition and the synthetic biology to the audience.At the same time, we also introduced the
                positive significance of our project to synthetic biology to the audience. We received useful feedbacks
                and technology-improvement suggestions from audience.</p>
            <h1>Integrated Human Practice</h1>
            <h3>Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan</h3>
            <p>We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chung Hsing
                University from July 30th to August 3rd 2018. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 5 members
                of our team was sent to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The
                conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian
                regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as
                well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received
                useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3>Software Promotion</h3>
            <p>Since our software is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists,
                itâ€™s of great importance to promote our software to synthetic biology related users.</p>
            <p>To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, We packed up an alpha version distributing to
                schoolmates whose major is biology in September. And in October we packed a more advanced version to
                some igem teams worldwide. We introduced them to Bioeditor and its basic usage. After they had used this
                software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful. And then we have packed our
                completed version to the real synthetic biologists by now.</p>
