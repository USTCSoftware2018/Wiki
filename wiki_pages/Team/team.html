                        I'm Zheng Qixuan, a junior student from University of Science and Technology of China majoring in electronic engineering and computer science. I prefer something 'geek', just like robots, cybernetic and artificial intelligence. I also like to do some running in the evening(well, just in order to lose weight and pressure). I am interested in trying something new, so I joined this team. This is the first time I take part in a large project. The backend part I take part in looks amazing and have really learned a lot, not only how to build a project but also better communicate with teammates. Hope what we have done could make some help and we can get the Grand Prize!
