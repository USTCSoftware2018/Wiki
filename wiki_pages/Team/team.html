                        I'm Zheng Qixuan, a junior student from University of Science and Technology of China majoring in electronic engineering and computer science. I prefer something 'geek', just like robots, cybernetic and artificial intelligence. I also like to do some running in the evening(well, just in order to lose weight and pressure). I am interested in trying something new, so I joined this team. This is the first time I take part in a large project. The backend part I take part in looks amazing and have really learned a lot, not only how to build a project but also better communicate with teammates. Hope what we have done could make some help and we can get the Grand Prize!

The first year working with team members in 2017 USTC really open me a different road and it is really my luck to be with them, so I decided to take part in IGEM 2018. It is really a amazing and fresh experience for me to work with such intelligent guys, majoring in different departments. They have so many ideas that I have never thought about and it is really cool to cooperate with them.
