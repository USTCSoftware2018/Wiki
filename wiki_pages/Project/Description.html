            <h5>What is BioHub 3.0</h5>
            <p>BioHub 3.0 is a synthetic biology community, integrated Intelligent Search Engine and the online report
                editor. It brings you a new way to edit your reports and search whatever you need only in one step.</p>
            <h5>The Editor</h5>
            <p>We established a standardized description of experimental steps. The editor can help you complete
                high-quality lab reports quickly just by choosing steps and filling in the blanks. Custom steps and
                protocols are also supported. And in our report editor, biologists could use a number of practical tools
                such as drawing, tabulation and writing articles, which improve the efficiency of completing the
                experiment report.</p>
            <h5>Intelligent Search Engine</h5>
            <p>We developed our search engine on the base of 2017's project. Our engine has a better command of language
                recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like "reports today", "reports by ana", "reports this
                year" and edc.. Meanwhile, we listened to the opinions of the judges. This year we added advanced search
                and we can now sort the results by time, labels, etc.. It is easier for synthetic biologists to find
                what they need without many input's instructions. Additionally, we have added many useful databases and
                academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could search information more quickly.</p>
            <h5>The community</h5>
            <p>In this community, bio workers can record their experimental process and release those reports.
                Meanwhile, they could also read and comment on other scholar's reports. In this way, we make the
                academic discussion more convinent. We provide both site search and off-site search to provide better
                user experience.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3 id="Motivation">Motivation</h3>
            <p>After consulting with several synthetic biology workers, we found that they would inevitably suffer from
                the need to spend a lot of time to complete the experimental report during the experiment. Therefore,
                there is an urgent need for a editor that provides a number of practical tools such as drawing,
                tabulation, writing articles by dragging steps or protocols to improve the efficiency. So it can replace
                the original Pages or Microsoft Office for its convenience.

                As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we
                reidesigned functions of search engines. Researchers can easily find reports written by others after
                inputting some key words. They could also search information in some databases and websites directly
                though this engine.

                For most synthetic biology workers, it is difficult for them to conduct effective communication on
                experimental content, so we established a synthetic biology community based on search engine and report
                editor. In this community, bio workers can use this to record their experimental process and comment on
                other scholar's reports, thereby reducing the blindness of the research.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3 id="Future">In The Future</h3>
            <p>As the advanced architecture and plugin system designed in our Biohub 3.0. It's pretty easy to improve
                our existed functions and provide new function by activating new plugins. Here are what we want to do in
                the future.</p>
            <h5>Improvements</h5>

            <p>It is super easy to accomplish your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.</p>
            <ul>
                <ol>We believe it is possible to share your protocols and steps with anyone freely.</ol>
                <ol>It is great significant to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.</ol>
                <ol>Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.</ol>
            </ul>
            <p>The Search Engine at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language
                processing technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting
                more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.

                The society is still growing. That is why chatting and communication could be considered as an important
                facility in our society.</p>
            <h5>New Features</h5>
            <p>Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without
                refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or plugin.

                In the next generation of Biohub, We want to strengthen our society and build a society like Quora where
                biologists can post their ideas, ask questions, sale their e-books, have a free chat or find partners
                who share interest in a certain area.

                If there is a matching hardware port, it could complete the experiment automatically according to the
                given steps and protocols. We could match the steps or protocols to the manipulator's operating
                instructions accurately. For this, we hope BioHub can help achieve experiment automation.</p>
