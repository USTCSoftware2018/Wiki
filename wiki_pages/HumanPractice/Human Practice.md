### Human Practice

#### Science and Technology Week

Science and Technology Week is a large-scale, centralized science popularization campaign organized by the China University of Science and Technology. This year, Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from primary pupils, high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors a feast of biological knowledge and a chance to cultivate interest in biology.

We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation and our explanation,  showed them some basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc.Then we educated and inspired visitors' interest by allowing them to observe biochemical-related sections under a laboratory microscope. In addition, we distributed questionnaires to visitors to get their feedback on synthetic biology to improve our design of our software.

### Integrated Human Practice

#### Student Open Source Conference

The Student Open Source Annual Meeting was the first open source technology summit in China that was organized by student organizations. The main theme of the conference is understand, participate in, and contribute to open source. Our team signed up for this annual meeting.And at the meeting, our team leader and a team member worked together to complete the report on our iGEM project. We introduced the iGEM competition and the synthetic biology to the audience.At the same time, we also introduced the positive significance of our project to synthetic biology to the audience. We received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from audience.

#### Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan

We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chung Hsing University from July 30th to August 3rd 2018. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 5 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.

During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, exchanged ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.
