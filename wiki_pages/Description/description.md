#### Overview

##### What is BioHub 3.0?

BioHub 3.0 is a synthetic biology community, integrated **Intelligent Search Engine** and the online report **editor**. It brings you a new way to edit your reports and search whatever you need only in one step.

##### The Editor

We established a standardized description of experimental steps. The editor can help you complete high-quality lab reports quickly just by choosing steps and filling in the blanks. Custom steps and protocols are also supported. And in our report editor, biologists could use a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation and writing articles, which improve the efficiency of completing the experiment report.

##### Intelligent Search Engine

We developed our search engine on the base of 2017's project. Our engine has a better command of language recognition. It supports semantic recognition, like "reports today", "reports by ana", "reports this year" and etc.. Meanwhile, we listened to the opinions of the judges. This year we added advanced search and we can now sort the results by time, labels, etc.. It is easier for synthetic biologists to find what they need without many input's instructions. Additionally, we have added many useful databases and academic websites to our search engine, so biologists could search information more quickly.

##### The community

In this extensible community, bio workers can record their experimental process and release those reports. Meanwhile, they could also read and comment on other scholar's reports. In this way, we make the academic discussion more convinent.  We provide both site search and off-site search to provide better user experience. Many fantastic functions could be integrated in this extensible community in the future.

#### Motivation

After consulting with several synthetic biology workers, we found that they would inevitably suffer from the need to spend a lot of time to complete the experimental report during the experiment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a editor that provides a number of practical tools such as drawing, tabulation, writing articles by dragging steps or protocols to improve the efficiency. So it can replace the original Pages or Microsoft Office for its convenience.

As we all know, too programmer-style search engine is very unfriendly to synthetic biologists, so we reidesigned functions of search engines. Researchers can easily find reports written by others after inputting some key words. They could also search information in some databases and websites directly though this engine.      

 For most synthetic biology workers, it is difficult for them to conduct effective communication on experimental content, so we established a synthetic biology community based on search engine and report editor. In this community, bio workers can use this to record their experimental process and comment on other scholar's reports, thereby reducing the blindness of the research.
