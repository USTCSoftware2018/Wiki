# In the future 

As the advanced architecture and plugin system designed in our Biohub 3.0. It's pretty easy to improve our existed functions and  provide new function by activating new plugins. Here are what we want to do in the future.

## Improvements

It is super easy to accomplish  your report rapidly by useing our editor. But we can make it better.

* We believe it is possible to share your `protocols` and `steps` with anyone freely.
* It is great significant  to make it more efficient to build a new step or protocol.
* Our editor takes too much memories and will be slow down when the report goes long.

The `Search Engine` at the moment supports searching by nature language thanks to the new nature language processing  technology. The intelligence can be improved in understanding what users want and reacting more smartly. On the other hand, we can integrate more databases which are most used by biologists.

The society  is still growing. That is why chatting and communication  could be considered as an important facility in our society.

## New features

Several Interface has been implemented to make it easy to improve Biohub in the future without refactoring core codes. New codes can be considered as a module or  plugin.

In the next generation of Biohub, We want to strengthen our society and build a society like `Quora` where biologists  can post their ideas, ask questions, sale their e-books, have a free chat or find partners who share interest in a certain area.
