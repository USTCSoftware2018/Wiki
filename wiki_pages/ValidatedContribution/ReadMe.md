Look! A lovely panda is shaking its hands to welcome you once you hang your mouse over it.

## Edit a new report

This online `editor` is a good way of recording your experiment. Once finishing reading this brief guide, you will know how fast and how easy we can achieve this goal.

We divide an experiment report into three parts: `info`, `protocol` and `Result`

Here is the appearance of our `editor` and it initials an empty report when the `editor` button on the top is clicked:

![editor](./img/editor_main.png)

In the Info block, you can input title, labels and abstract like this:

![editor](./img/editor_info.png)

On the left side is a toolbox that contains `protocols` and `steps`. You can see there are some several steps and protocol that is created for you, you can create more steps and protocols as you wish.

Now let's click the `Add` step to see what will happen.

![editor](./img/editor_step.png)

A new `Centrifuge` Step is inserted into the report. The only thing you need to do is to fill some blanks. That is how you record a '12000 rpm centrifuge for 30 s at 25 degrees.'. Is that amazing? But we can make it much faster.

`protocol` is a set of steps or a template. Let's try `Gel Extraction`.

![editor](./img/editor_protocol.png)

A serial of steps is inserted into your report and most of these blanks are accomplished by our templates.

It is true that the available `steps` and `protocols` are not able to meet all your demands. But you can create new steps and protocol. Here is an example:

![editor](./img/editor_new.png)

A new `step` called `Add something into burette` is created in the step bar and you can insert it into your report.

![editor](./img/editor_new_step.png)

`Environment Variable` is another way to help you to accomplish your writing. Click the `VAR` button and define some variables.

![editor](./img/editor_var.png)

In that way, the `editor` will replace all `@v1` pattern into `30` and `@v2` pattern into `PCR` in the report.

The third section of a report is results. In this section, it is free to insert some texts, pictures, lists, and tables to record the results.

Click these buttons on the right side of the editor to insert them into your report.

![editor](./img/editor_result.png)

If you can not find those buttons, click the little blue cat button.

After finishing editing, click the `Save` button to save it and `preview` button to have a look of your work.

![editor](./img/editor_preview.png)

You can see all sentences are produced automatically. Click `Export` button to download your work in `PDF`.

## Intelligent Search Engine

Our Search Engine is much more Intelligent and useful than Biohub 2.0.

It not only supports searching Users or Articles, but also supports customize filter and sort rules in **natural language**. It means we support sentences like 'reports by Jiyan in this year' and 'reports with label PCR'. It is gorgeous and easy to use.

We support an integrated search that is connected to more than 50 websites like NLM, PubMed, PMC and so on.

`Bio-bricks` is the traditional function in Biohub 2.0, and it will be supported in the long term. `BLAST` is useful to search gene segment like 'AGGT'.

## Society

You can see the details of all reports and leave a comment or like the report. In that way, the author will receive the feeds.

In that way, we build a scientific society where the academic discussion is possible
